 <h3>Cooking</h3> 
  <p> There are many <strong> methods of cooking</strong>, most of which have been known since antiquity. These include <em> baking, roasting, frying, grilling, barbecuing, smoking, boiling, steaming and braising.</em> A more recent innovation is microwaving. Various methods use differing levels of heat and moisture and vary in cooking time.</p>
